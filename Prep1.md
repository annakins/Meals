## Meals
### Chocolate Blueberry Smoothie
- 3/4 cup frozen blueberries
- 1 banana
- Half a clementine
- 3 brazil nuts
- 1/4 cup cashews 
- 1 teaspoon hemp seeds 
- 1 cup coconut water
- 1.5 scoops chocolate pea protein powder
- Ice

#### Actions
- Use a blender.

### Chickpea Tuna
- Equivalent of 1 can garbanzo beans (drain, rinse, then mash)
- 1/4 c. vegenaise
- 1/2 lemon (juice)
- 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/3 c. red onion (dice)
- 3 tbsp. fresh parsley (finely chop) or 1/2 tsp dried
- 3 tbsp. relish
- 2 Ezekiel bread
- 2 slices of cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Nutritional yeast?

#### Actions
- Soak 1 cup of dried chickpeas overnight (this yields 3 cups of cooked chickpeas).
- Next day: Get a bowl out. Put the chickpeas in there, as well as the other ingredients.
- Toast 2 slices of bread for 7 minutes in my air fryer to get them extra crispy. 
- With one minute left, add vegenaise and then a slice of cheese to each bread slice. 
- Once done, top with lettuce, then add the chickpea salad. 
- Best served after 30 minutes in the fridge as the chickpeas soak up the juices and flavors.

### Pasta
- Explore Cuisine pasta
- Grape tomatoes
- Olive oil
- Red pepper flakes
- Fresh parsley
- Salt to taste
- Nutritional yeast

#### Actions
- Cook Explore Cuisine's pasta according to the box instructions, but toss a handful or two of grape tomatoes in the water while it’s coming to a boil. 
- The tomatoes should be perfectly cooked by the time the pasta is done, no matter which type of Explore Cuisine pasta you’re using. These grape tomatoes burst in the heat and it makes them so, so good. 
- Once the pasta and tomatoes are cooked, drain most of the water, leaving a small amount, roughly 2 tbsps, to help the pasta from over-drying while adding toppings.
- Add in olive oil. 
- Give it a toss to coat, then add extras like red pepper flakes, fresh parsley, and salt. 
- Lastly, top the pasta with nutritional yeast.

### Snacks
- Clementines or berries and cashews or sprouted pumpkin seeds.

### Cost
- To be edited.
